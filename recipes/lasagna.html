    <h2>ingredints needed</h2>

        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cups Parmeson Cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>1 lbs Ground Beef</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

    <h3>Prep work<h3></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the <b>cheese filling ingredients</b> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
    </ol>

    <h2>Meat Sauce</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. 
            (This allows them to release a little 
            sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. 
            Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. 
            Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. 
            Drain excess grease.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and 
            sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and 
            Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover 
            partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.
        </li>
    </ol>
